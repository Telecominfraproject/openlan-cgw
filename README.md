# openlan-cgw - What is it?
Cloud GateWay (CGW) is a Rust-based implementation of the uCentral-protocol-based Gateway layer (link).
CGW, like OWGW, manages device (Access Points and OpenLan switches) that implement and abide the uCentral protocol.
The main reasoning behind a new implementation of the GW is the horizontal scalability.
# Dependencies (runtime)
CGW requires a set of tools and services to operate and function. Some of them are embedded into the application itself and require no external utilities,
while others are required to be running for the CGW to operate.

**NOTE**: while runtime CGW depends on services like kafka, redis and PSQL, the *make* / *make all* targets
would build a complete out-of-the-box setup with default configs and container params:
- Kafka, Redis, PSQL containers would be created and attached to default - automatically created - *docker_cgw_multi_instances_network* network;
  All three (and one additional - *init-broker-container* - needed for kafka topics initialization) are all part of single docker compose file.
- CGW, while also part of the same docker compose file, yet is being partially generated.
  The reason, is that multiple CGW instances can be created within single compose-file,
and thus container details are being generated.

More information about the compose generation can be found in the
'Automated multi-CGW instances start/stop with Docker Compose' topic.

## gRPC
CGW utilizes gRPC to communicate with other CGW instances (referred to as Shards). This functionality does not depend on some external third party services.
## Kafka
CGW uses Kafka as a main North-Bound API layer for communication with NB services. The "cnc" topic is used for commands and requests handling, "cnc_res" is used to send replies/results back (CGW reads "cnc" and writes into "cnc_res").
### Topics auto-creation
CGW upon startup is responsible for creating topics that are required, hence no additional actions are required.
List of topics to-be-created: 'cnc', 'cnc_res', 'connection', 'infra_realtime', 'topology', 'state'.
## PSQL
Application utilizes relational DB (PSQL) to store registered Infrastructure Groups as well as registered Infrastructures.
### Requirements
1. It's required for the PSQL to have the following tables pre-made upon CGW launch:
```
CREATE TABLE infrastructure_groups
(
id INT PRIMARY KEY,
reserved_size INT,
actual_size INT
);
CREATE TABLE infras
(
mac MACADDR PRIMARY KEY,
infra_group_id INT,
FOREIGN KEY(infra_group_id) REFERENCES infrastructure_groups(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```
2. Default user 'cgw' and password '123' is assumed, but it can be changed through the env variables.
## Redis
fast in-memory DB that CGW uses to store all needed runtime information (InfraGroup assigned CGW id, remote CGW info - IP, gRPC port etc)

# (Kafka) API Description
The listed files here are definitive descriptions of how CGW Kafka API works - what request types CGW supports, what responses
it can generate as well as the list of supported events that application can deliver to event-specific kafka topics.

# cnc_api.yaml
List of Command and Control API requests that CGW can understand and handle when retrieved from (default) 'cnc' kafka topic.

# cnc_res_api.yaml
List of Command and Control API *responses* that CGW will generate as a result to prior 'cnc' request and put them
into (default) 'cnc_res' topic.
# events.yaml
List of special events (Infrastructure came up _online_ / _offline_, unassigned infra connected etc) that CGW
can generate as a result to some special event / action happened to the CGW itself, or the underlying infras.

# Kafka topic to message type mapping
While the CGW utilizes a single - Kafka - bus to expose it's API, the API itself is still divided into list of kafka topics.
Each of the kafka topics logically separates control messages and replies to those messages, telemetry data and status, alarms
and so on.

## Mapping table (message type to topic name)
The following table displays the relation between which messages (ordered by type) are being put to which
kafka topic (default names listed.
*Type* column specifies the src file and underlying message type:
- *req* = `cnc_api.yaml` requests directed to CGW (input)
- *res* = `cnc_res.yaml` responses sent by CGW (output)
- *evt* = `events.yaml` events generated by CGW (output)

# Building
*NOTE:* The following target builds CGW and also starts up required services with default config and params
```console
$ make all
```
Two new docker images will be generated on host system:
**openlan_cgw** - image that holds CGW application itself
**cgw_build_env** - building environment docker image that is used for generating openlan_cgw
# Running
The following script can be used to launch the CGW app
```console
$ make
```
Command creates and executed (starts) docker container group consisting of cgw services
as well as third part depending services (redis, kafka, psql)

To stop the container from running (remove it) use the following cmd:
```console
$ make stop
```
Running application with default arguments might not be desired behavior.
And thus the run script utilizes the following list of *environment* variables that you can define before running it to alternate behavior of the app.

# Certificates
The CGW uses two different sets of certificate configuration:
1. AP/Switch connectivity (southbound)
2. Infrastructure connectivity (northbound)

The AP/Switch connectivity uses a number of certificates to provide security (mTLS).
There are 2 types of certificates required for a normal deployment:
1. Server certificates
2. Client certificates

The certificates are accessible from CGW docker container via volume: [/etc/cgw/certs]

There are several environment variable to configure certificates path and names to be used within CGW:
1. CGW_WSS_CERT - CGW WSS Certificate
2. CGW_WSS_KEY - CGW WSS Private Key
3. CGW_WSS_CAS - Chain certificates to validate client (root/issuer)
4. CGW_CERTS_PATH - path to certificates located on host machine

The infrastructure connectivity use root certs store - the directory with trusted certificates
The environment variable to configure certificates path:
1. CGW_NB_INFRA_CERTS_PATH - path to certificates located on host machine

# Automated Testing
Automated python-based tests are located inside the *tests* directory.
Currently, tests should be run manually by changing PWD to *tests* and launching helper script *run.sh*:
```console
cd ./test
./run.sh
```
or using make target (added for convenience):
```console
make run-tests
```
*NOTE:* currently, tests are not running inside a container.
To make sure tests can communicate with CGW-environment, tests are currently
reaching environment through ports exposed to host system.
e.g. for WSS - tests try to reach 'wss://localhost:15002' by default and so on.

# Automated multi-CGW instances start/stop with Docker Compose
Automated multi-CGW start/stop based on "docker-compose-template.yml.j2" file located inside the *utils/docker* directory.
To bring-up multiple (minimum 1) CGW instances we use templated "docker-compose-template.yml.j2" file.
The "StartMultiCGW.py" script located inside the *utils/docker* directory used to:
  1. Stop all running Docker Composes.
  2. Update/generate certificates
  3. Generate "docker-compose-multi-cgw.yml" Docker Compose file that includes:
    - Kafka service
    - Redis service
    - PostgreSQL service
    - [N] CGW instances
  4. Start Docker Compose using generated "docker-compose-multi-cgw.yml" file.

The "CGW_INSTANCES_NUM" environment variable is used to specify number of CGW instances.
Makefile has 2 targets to start/stop Docker Compose
  - start-multi-cgw
  - stop-multi-cgw
